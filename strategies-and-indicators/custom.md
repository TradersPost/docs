# Custom

## How it works

Here are the steps we will take to complete the development of your custom strategy.

### **Free Consultation**

In this step, we'll discuss your ideas, give our thoughts, plan out how we'll approach building the strategy, discuss what is possible and get all the requirements documented in order to provide a cost estimate and proposal for you to review.

### Cost Estimate & Proposal

After our initial consultation, we will review all the requirements and speak with our custom strategy development team in order to form a cost estimate and proposal for you to review.

### Payment

Once the initial consultation is done and proposal is accepted by the customer, 50% of payment must be made before development of the strategy can begin.

### Development

During this phase, we will develop the strategy to your specification and deliver a working version of the strategy for you to test and give feedback. We will iterate on the strategy and gather feedback from you as necessary in order for it to meet your requirements.

### Training

We will teach you how to use the strategy, how to configure it and how to use it with TradersPost in order to automate all of the order execution.

### Final Payment

Once development and training are complete, the remaining 50% payment will be collected by TradersPost.

### Delivery

Once full payment is completed, the final strategy and source code will be delivered to the customer.
