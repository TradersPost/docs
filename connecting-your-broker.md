## Connect a Broker

Hover over **Brokers** in the main navigation menu and click **Connected Brokers**.

![Navigate to Connected Brokers menu.](https://traderspost.io/images/docs/getting-started/connected-brokers-nav.png)

Once you arrive on this page, choose the broker you wish to connect. For the purposes of this document, we will connect an **Alpaca** account. Click the **Alpaca** row to continue to the next step.

![Pick a broker to connect.](https://traderspost.io/images/docs/getting-started/choose-broker-list.png)

After clicking on **Alpaca** you will be presented with a page asking you to login to your **Alpaca** account.

![Login to your Alpaca account.](https://traderspost.io/images/docs/getting-started/alpaca-login-screen.png)

If you donâ€™t already have an **Alpaca** account, create one here [https://app.alpaca.markets/signup](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup)

After logging in to your **Alpaca** account, **Alpaca** will ask you to authorize **TradersPost** to access your account. Click **Allow** to continue.

![Authorize TradersPost to access your Alpaca account.](https://traderspost.io/images/docs/getting-started/authorize-alpaca-screen.png)

Now you have your **Alpaca** account connected to TradersPost.

## Create a Strategy Subscription

Hover over **Strategies** and click **Subscriptions**.

![Navigate to Subscriptions menu.](https://traderspost.io/images/docs/getting-started/subscriptions-nav.png)

Now click **New Subscription** to view the list of available strategies to subscribe to.

![Create a new subscription.](https://traderspost.io/images/docs/getting-started/subscriptions-screen.png)

Click the **Subscribe** button next to the **MOMO** strategy created by **WageNet**.

![Choose the strategy you want to subscribe to.](https://traderspost.io/images/docs/getting-started/subscribe-strategy.png)

Now you will see a form to create a **New Subscription**.

![Configure your strategy subscription.](https://traderspost.io/images/docs/getting-started/new-subscription.png)

Enter the details of your **MOMO** subscription in this form.

## Max Strategy Positions

On each connected broker you can configure a **Max Strategy Positions** value and TradersPost will not allow any more positions to be opened than you have configured.

In this example if you have 5 open positions and you get a signal from a strategy subscription that would result in a 6th open position, then the trade signal will be rejected.
