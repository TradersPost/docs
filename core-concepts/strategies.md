## Create a Strategy

Lets get started by creating your first strategy in TradersPost!

1. Navigate to **Strategies** and click the **New Strategy** button at the top right.
2. Give your strategy a **Name** and choose which **Asset class** you want your strategy to trade.
3. Finally, click the **Save** button and your strategy will be created.

Now you are ready to connect your strategy to your broker using a [subscription](subscriptions.md).
