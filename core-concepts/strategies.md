# Strategies

## Create a Strategy

Once you have created a webhook, you will be ready to create a strategy.

1. Navigate to **Strategies** and click the **New Strategy** button at the top right. Give it a name and choose which webhook you want the strategy to be linked to.
2. Scroll down and you can optionally fill in the fields under the section named **Additional Details**. These fields are only useful if other users will be subscribing to your strategy.
3. Next, scroll down to the **Subscription Defaults** section. These are the default setting values that get used when a new subscription is created for the strategy. Subscriptions can customize these settings after the subscription is created.
4. Finally, click the **Save** button and your strategy will be created.

Now you are ready to connect your strategy to your broker using a [subscription](subscriptions.md).
