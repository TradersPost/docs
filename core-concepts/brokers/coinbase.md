# Coinbase

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Coinbase integration is generally available for all TradersPost customers. Please remember that this integration is in <mark style="color:orange;">**BETA**</mark> and you may experience issues that we have not discovered yet. It is recommended to test with small position size first. If you have any issues or questions, please email us at [support@traderspost.io](mailto:support@traderspost.io)
{% endhint %}

## Default Quote Currency

Coinbase offers multiple quote markets to trade your crypto assets: USD, USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH and BTC. Currently TradersPost supports USD, USDC, USDT, and DAI. When setting up your Coinbase broker connection, be sure to decide which default quote currency you want to manage your positions with. In instances where you request to close or exit a position, this default quote currency is used to liquidate the position.

**USD is the default value if nothing is selected or the asset cannot be quoted in the default quote currency selected.** For example, if you have USDT selected and try to liquidate a STORJ position, it will be sold in USD since there is no support for STORJ-USDT.
