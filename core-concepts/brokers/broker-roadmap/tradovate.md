## Reliability

Tradovate is a new broker integration for TradersPost, but generally it has been stable so far.

## Supported Asset Classes

* Futures

## Limitations

The Tradovate integration comes with a few limitations compared to other integrations. These limitations may change in the future as we are able to improve the integration.

### Market Data

The TradersPost + Tradovate integration currently does not have quotes/market data. This may change in the future if we are able to implement market data. Without market data, we aren't able to implement the following features:

* Limit orders without a price in the signal. If limit orders are configured and the signal does not have a price, then a market order will be submitted.
* No take profit or stop loss functionality.
* No trailing stop functionality.
* No Profit & Loss or current price data on open positions.
