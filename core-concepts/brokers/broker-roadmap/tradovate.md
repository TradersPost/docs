## Limitations

The TradersPost + Tradovate integration currently does not support market data so we are not able to fetch quotes. This means we have the following limitations:

### Limit orders without a price in the signal

This means you are required to send a price in your signal since we aren't able to fetch quotes. In the following example, since we are entering with a market order and we don't know what price you will be filled at, we will use the `signalPrice` to calculate the limit order limit price of `$18600`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If limit orders are configured and the signal does not have a price, then a market order will be submitted.
{% endhint %}

```json
{
    "ticker": "MNQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "orderType": "market",
    "signalPrice": 18500,
    "takeProfit": {
        "amount": 100
    }
}
```

And if you are using limit orders, then the entry limit price will be used to calculate the take profit limit price. In this example, a take profit limit order will be calculated with a limit price of `$18600`.

```json
{
    "ticker": "MNQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "orderType": "limit",
    "limitPrice": 18500,
    "takeProfit": {
        "amount": 100
    }
}
```

### No Profit & Loss or current price data on open positions.

Since we aren't able to use your market data or fetch quotes, we aren't able to show open position P\&L.

### Is the API Access Add-On Required to use Tradovate?

No, the API Access Add-On that Tradovate charges a monthly subscription for is not required to use TradersPost.
