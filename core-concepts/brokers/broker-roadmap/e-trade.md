## Authentication

E\*TRADE access tokens last for two weeks (15 days) after you connect it to TradersPost. This means that after 15 days, your connection will expire and you will need to reconnect your account to TradersPost. This is unfortunately out of our control and it is a rule defined by E\*TRADE that is different than other brokers and exchanges we integrate with.
