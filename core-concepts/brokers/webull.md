## Market Data

Webull does not yet provide access to market data through their API, so the we use market data from [Polygon](https://polygon.io/) at no additional charge to you.

## Authentication

Webull accounts can be connected to TradersPost manually by getting an access token from Webull. Unfortunately, Webull has not yet implemented OAuth with refresh tokens so you will need to manually do this and when the token expires, you will have to repeat the manual steps again to reconnect Webull to TradersPost.

To get started, first go to [Webull.com](https://webull.com) and login. Once logged in, click your profile icon at the top right and then click **My Account** from the menu.

Now click **Generate Key** and follow the steps to generate an API key. Copy this information and store it somewhere secure in a password manager like 1password.

Once you have your API Key and Secret, head over to TradersPost and click **Brokers**, then click **Connect Live**, choose **Webull** from the list of available brokers, paste your api key and secret in the form and click Save.
