# Brokers

At the core of TradersPost are the integrations with brokers. You can connect your broker to TradersPost and authorize our software to read your balances, open positions, open orders, order history, place trades and cancel orders.

{% hint style="warning" %}
TradersPost does not have access to your banking information and does not have the ability to transfer money in or out of your accounts. We only have access to the functionality to control trading activities.
{% endhint %}

## Connect Your Broker

To connect your broker to TradersPost, navigate to **Brokers > Connected Brokers** in the application and click **Connect Live Broker** or **Connect Paper Broker**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are just getting started, we recommend using the already connected built in TradersPost paper broker to run your first tests against.
{% endhint %}

Next, choose the broker you want to connect and follow the prompts. You will be redirected to the chosen broker and asked login and authorize TradersPost to access your account. Once you agree, you will be redirected back to TradersPost and your broker account will be connected to TradersPost.

## Supported Brokers

Check out our ever growing list of supported brokers. If you do not see your broker listed here, take a look at our [broker roadmap](broker-roadmap/). These are the brokers that are being actively worked on by our development team. You can also view a longer list of our [waitlist brokers](https://traderspost.io/brokers) that we may integrate in the future. Add your email to the wait list for the broker you are interested in to be notified when it is available in the future.
