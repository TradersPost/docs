## OAuth Support

We do plan to integrate Binance.com OAuth support in the future if we are able to get approved for it from Binance.

## Binance IP Whitelisting

At this time, TradersPost does not support Binance's IP whitelisting feature because our IP addresses are subject to change. This limitation means that Binance users cannot use TradersPost with IP restrictions enabled in their Binance account.

We understand that IP whitelisting is an important security feature for many traders. Thatâ€™s why we are actively working to enhance our infrastructure. Starting in Q1 of 2025, we will support static IPs, enabling Binance users to securely utilize the IP whitelisting feature with TradersPost. Stay tuned for updates as we roll out this improvement.
