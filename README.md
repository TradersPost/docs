# Introduction

### What is TradersPost?

TradersPost is a trading tool that can automate your TrendSpider or TradingView strategies in stock brokers like TD Ameritrade, TradeStation and Alpaca.

### Who is TradersPost for?

* **Strategy Managers** - a person that is interested in creating automated trading strategies and connecting them to their broker.
* **Traders and Investors** - a person that is interested in connecting automated trading strategies to their broker without any coding knowledge.

### How does it work?

TradersPost is made of the following concepts. You can use them together to create automated trading strategies in your broker and allow other people to subscribe to your strategies.

* [Signals](https://traderspost.io/docs#signals) - Signals are buy or sell signal that can be produced by an automated algorithm or even a manual human trader.
* [Strategies](https://traderspost.io/docs#strategies) - Strategies define a group of signals. Users can subscribe to strategies and have the signals place trades directly in their broker.
* [Brokers](https://traderspost.io/docs#brokers) - Bring your own broker by connecting it to TradersPost. We support several brokers like **TD Ameritrade**, **Alpaca** and **TradeStation**.
* [Subscriptions](https://traderspost.io/docs#subscriptions) - Subscriptions allow you to connect a strategy to a broker, define your risk tolerance and position sizing.
