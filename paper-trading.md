# Paper Trading

TradersPost provides basic paper trading functionality in addition to working with paper trading provided by third-party brokers. However, not all brokers provide simulated paper trading environments.

**Please note that trading with paper money is only a simulation. It provides an approximation for what to expect in real live trading, but it is not a substitute for real live trading and your performance may differ.**

Below you will find information about the brokers that do provide paper trading in addition to the paper trading functionality provided by TradersPost.

## Alpaca

Alpaca offers paper trading for free to all Alpaca users.

> Paper trading is a real-time simulation environment where you can test your code. You can reset and test your algorithm as much as you want using free, real-time market data. Everything on the broker side behaves the same way as the live account except the orders aren’t routed to the real exchanges. Instead, the system simulates the order filling based on the real-time quotes.

## TradersPost Paper

TradersPost offers a very basic paper trading functionality for testing your strategies. Please note the following about TradersPost paper accounts:

* Market hours are not respected and orders will fill 24/7
* Limit orders will fill at any price specified
* Market orders will fill at the last trade price if available or the ask for buy orders and the bid for sell orders.

It is recommended that you use one of the above simulated paper trading environments provided by a broker if you want a more real simulated environment. The TradersPost paper trading functionality is only useful for testing that your strategies are configured correctly but should not be used to measure the performance of your strategy.
