## Subscribe to Strategy

Now that your strategy is created, you are ready to connect it to your Alpaca broker by subscribing to the strategy. Click the broker that you want to connect the strategy to. In this example, we'll connect it to the paper Alpaca broker.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-05-06 at 2.03.16 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Check the **Confirm** checkbox and then click the **Confirm** button to continue.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-05-06 at 2.04.52 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Your new strategy subscription has been created, but it is not enabled yet. Lets customize some of the settings before we enable it.

Check the **Auto submit** checkbox and click **Enable**. We want **Auto submit** enabled because we want the trades to submit to the broker automatically, without us having to manually approve or reject each trade. If you leave this unchecked, you will be able to approve or reject the trade before it submits to the broker.

Your strategy subscription is now enabled! You are ready to start sending signals to TradersPost from your strategy.

## Copy Webhook URL

You can copy the webhook URL by clicking the **Copy** button above the example orders. This will put the webhook URL in your clipboard so you can paste it in to TradingView in the next steps.

## Setup TradingView Alerts

Now you have your TradersPost Webhook URL in your computers clipboard so you are ready to head over to TradingView and create an alert for your strategy or indicator.

First, load your strategy or indicator on your chart. If you don't have your own strategy or indicator, you can use this example [Trend Following MOMO](https://www.tradingview.com/script/Jrw5Qegy-Trend-Following-MOMO/) strategy by Matt DeLong.

Next, load the **SQ** ticker on your chart and click the **Create Alert** button at the top right of TradingView.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-03-02 at 9.34.55 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Fill out the **Settings** tab in the **Create Alert on SQ** form. Enter the following settings.

* Choose **Trend Following MOMO** from the **Condition** dropdown
* Choose **ProjectX Buy Alert** from the 2nd dropdown under Condition
* Click **Once Per Bar Close** next to the **Trigger** section.
* Give the alert a name like **TradersPost SQ Buy Alert**.
* Paste the following JSON in to the alert message textarea.

```json
{
    "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
    "action": "buy"
}
```

Now do the same thing for the sell side. Except choose **ProjectX Sell Alert** this time and paste the JSON for a sell in to the alert message textarea and then click the blue **Create** button.

```json
{
    "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
    "action": "sell"
}
