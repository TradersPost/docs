# Webhooks

## What is a webhook?

Webhooks are automated messages sent from applications when something happens. They have a message that can contain a payload of data and are sent to a unique URL.

In the context of automated trading, the webhook message contains all the information about the trade signal like what ticker to buy and at what price. Here is an example simple webhook.

```json
{
    "ticker": "AMD",
    "action": "buy"
}
```

Here is a full reference API documentation for the trading webhoook API end point.

{% swagger-response status="400: Bad Request" description="Rejected webhook response." %}
When a webhook request is sent to TradersPost, we run it through several different validation checks. If any of these validation rules fail, the webhook will respond like the following with a status code of 400.

Here is an example invalid JSON payload.

```json
{
    "ticker": "NQ",
    "action": "bu"
}
```

Here is the response you would get for that payload.

```json
{
    "success":false,
    "logId":"bf3b4869-bf85-48cc-a1b3-8e49c77215ae",
    "messageCode":"invalid-action",
    "message":"Invalid action provided. Action must be one of: buy, sell, exit, cancel, add."
}
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be sure you are aware of webhook rate limiting in TradersPost. You can read more [here](../additional-information/known-limitations.md#rate-limiting).
{% endhint %}

## Examples

Here are some example webhook JSON payloads to demonstrate the different use cases.

### Enter Bullish

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy"
}
```

### Exit Bullish

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "exit"
}
```

You can also use the sentiment field to exit a bullish position without entering a bearish position on the other side. When you send sentiment=flat, it will always exit the full quantity of the open position.

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "sell",
    "sentiment": "flat"
}
```

### Enter Bearish

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "sell"
}
```

### Exit Bearish

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "exit"
}
```

You can also use the sentiment field to exit a bearish position without entering a bullish position on the other side. When you send sentiment=flat, it will always exit the full quantity of the open position.

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "sentiment": "flat"
}
```

### Cancel Open Orders

Cancel all the open orders for the given ticker.

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "cancel"
}
```

### Add to Open Position

You can add to an existing open position by using the **add** action. This will add to the existing open position regardless of if **Allow add to position** is checked in your strategy subscription settings.

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "add"
}
```

### Signal Quantity

The signal quantity will only be used if you check **Use signal quantity** in the strategy subscription settings in TradersPost.

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "quantity": 5
}
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
The full quantity of the open position in the broker will be exited if you do not send a quantity in the exit signal. TradersPost is only able to partially exit open positions by sending the explicit quantity to exit in the webhook JSON.
{% endhint %}

### Signal Price

The signal price is optional. If you omit a price from the signal, the mid point between the bid and the ask will be used if you have limit orders configured.

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "price": 60.30
}
```

### Signal Take Profit

You can optionally send take profit information with your entry signals.

{% hint style="info" %}
The signal take profit will only be used if you check **Use signal take profit** in the strategy subscription settings in TradersPost.
{% endhint %}

The following fields are allowed on the **takeProfit** object, but never together. You can only choose one of the three types of take profit types (limitPrice, percent, or amount).

* **limitPrice** - Absolute limit price calculated on the webhook sender side.
* **percent**: Relative percentage take profit to calculate relative to entry price. The entry price for market orders is estimated based on the mid point between the bid and ask on the most recent quote.
* **amount** - Relative dollar amount take profit to calculate relative to entry price. The entry price for market orders is estimated based on the mid point between the bid and ask on the most recent quote.

#### **Percentage take profit calculated relative to entry price.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "takeProfit": {
        "percent": 10
    }
}
```

#### **Dollar amount take profit calculated relative to entry price.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "takeProfit": {
        "amount": 10
    }
}
```

#### **Absolute take profit calculated on the webhook sender side.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "takeProfit": {
        "limitPrice": 19.99
    }
}
```

### Signal Stop Loss

You can optionally send stop loss information with your entry signals.

{% hint style="info" %}
The signal stop loss will only be used if you check **Use signal stop loss** in the strategy subscription settings in TradersPost.
{% endhint %}

The following fields are allowed on the **stopLoss** object.

* **type** - Type of stop loss. If a value is provided, it overrides the stop loss type configured in strategy subscription settings. Allowed values are: stop, stop\__limit, trailing\_stop._
* **percent**: Relative percentage stop loss to calculate relative to entry price.
* **amount** - Relative dollar amount stop loss to calculate relative to entry price.
* **stopPrice** - Absolute stop price calculated on the webhook sender side.
* **limitPrice** - Absolute limit price calculated on the webhook sender side. **type** must be set to **stop\_limit** to use this field.
* **trailPrice** - A dollar value away from the highest water mark. If you set this to 2.00 for a sell trailing stop, the stop price is always hwm - 2.00. **type** must be set to **trailing\_stop** to use this field.
* **trailPercent** - A percent value away from the highest water mark. If you set this to 1.0 for a sell trailing stop, the stop price is always hwm \* 0.99. **type** must be set to **trailing\_stop** to use this field.

**Percentage stop loss calculated relative to entry price.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "stopLoss": {
        "percent": 5
    }
}
```

#### **Dollar amount stop loss calculated relative to entry price.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "stopLoss": {
        "amount": 5
    }
}
```

#### **Absolute stop price calculated on the webhook sender side.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "stopLoss": {
        "stopPrice": 10.71
    }
}
```

#### **Or with a stop limit instead of stop market.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "stopLoss": {
        "type": "stop_limit",
        "stopPrice": 10.71,
        "limitPrice": 10.75
    }
}
```

#### **Use a 1% trailing stop trail percent.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "stopLoss": {
        "type": "trailing_stop",
        "trailPercent": 1
    }
}
```

#### **Use a $1 trailing stop trail price.**

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "stopLoss": {
        "type": "trailing_stop",
        "trailPrice": 1
    }
}
```

### Take Profit & Stop Loss

You can use the take profit and stop loss functionality together. Just send us both the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` with your entry signal. Here is an example.

```json
{
    "ticker": "SQ",
    "action": "buy",
    "takeProfit": {
        "limitPrice": 19.99
    },
    "stopLoss": {
        "stopPrice": 10.71
    }
}
```

## 400 Bad Request

The JSON that gets sent to TradersPost has to be precisely accurate in order for us to accept it. It is important to pay attention all the details, all the little characters have meaning and are important. Here are the types of errors you may encounter when sending JSON to TradersPost webhooks.

**post-required** - HTTP POST method is required.

All webhook HTTP requests must be sent with a request method of POST. All other request methods will not be accepted.

**malformed-json** - Could not parse JSON payload.

If you have a parse error in your JSON code, TradersPost will not be able to extract the instructions from the signal. Here are some common mistakes people make.

**No trailing comma**

Notice the trailing comma on line 3, the JSON specification requires that there be no final trailing comma on the last item in a JSON object.

```json
{
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "action": "buy",
}
```

Here is the corrected JSON.

```json
{
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "action": "buy"
}
```

**Invalid double quote character**

Some applications will convert a double quote like `"quote"` to a left and right side double quote like `“quote”`. Notice the difference between `"` and `“` . JSON parsers don't like it when you use the latter. Here is an example invalid signal.

```
{
    “ticker”: “TSLA”,
    “action”: “buy”
}
```

Here is the corrected JSON.

```json
{
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "action": "buy"
}
```

**invalid-payload** - Invalid payload. action and ticker is required.

The minimum required fields are an action and ticker. All other fields are optional.

**invalid-action** - Invalid action provided.

Action must be one of: buy, sell, exit, cancel, add. The available actions available for webhooks are buy, sell, exit, cancel and add.

**invalid-sentiment** - Invalid sentiment provided.

Sentiment must be one of: bullish, bearish, flat. The available sentiments are bullish, bearish and flat. You can optionally exchange long for bullish and short for bearish. This is for compatibility with TradingView strategies out of the box.

**invalid-sentiment-action** - Invalid sentiment action provided.

Sentiment can only be used with action buy or sell. You can only pass a sentiment in a webhook request when using action=buy or action=sell.

**not-trading-view** - Request did not come from TradingView.

If you check Limit to TradingView in your webhook configuration, then the only IP addresses that will be allowed to send a request to it will be from TradingView.

**not-trend-spider** - Request did not come from TrendSpider.

If you check Limit to TrendSpider in your webhook configuration, then the only IP addresses that will be allowed to send a request to it will be from TrendSpider.

**invalid-ip-address** - Request did not come from configured IP addresses.

If you enter an ip address in Limit to IP Addresses in your webhook configuration, then the only IP addresses that will be allowed to send a request to it will be from the configure ip addresses.

**ticker-does-not-exist** - Ticker does not exist.

If the passed ticker does not exist in our ticker database then the webhook request will be rejected.

**invalid-password** - Password is invalid.

Every webhook has a password that can be regenerated by clicking the Generate New URL button when viewing a webhook

**empty-ticker-name** - Empty ticker name provided.

Sending an empty ticker name is not allowed.

```json
{
    "ticker": "",
    "action": "buy"
}
```

**unsupported-ticker** - Ticker is not allowed on this webhook.

If your webhook is restricted to a specific list of tickers and you send a ticker not in that list, then the webhook request will be rejected.

i**nvalid-quantity** - Invalid quantity.

Quantities must be a valid numeric value. Any other non numeric values will cause the webhook request to be rejected.

**invalid-asset-class** - Invalid asset class.

If you send a ticker for an asset class that the webhook does not support, then the webhook request will be rejected.

## Third Parties

Because TradersPost works using standard webhooks, this enables users to integrate with third party platforms that support sending alerts as webhooks.

Here are some popular platforms that enable you to build strategies and send alerts as webhooks.

* [TradingView](tradingview.md) - TradingView is a social network of 30 million traders and investors using the world's best charts and tools to spot trading opportunities across global markets.
* [TrendSpider](trend-spider.md) - TrendSpider provides technical analysis software for retail traders and investors focused on the US equity and foreign exchange markets.

## Custom Code

In addition to sending webhooks from third parties, you can send webhooks to TradersPost from custom code using programming languages like [PHP](https://php.net) or [Python](https://www.python.org). Here is an example using [PHP](https://php.net) and the [Symfony HTTP Client](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http\_client.html).

This example uses [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager. First create a new directory to work inside of.

```bash
mkdir traderspost
cd traderspost
```

Now require the `symfony/http-client` package using composer.

```
composer require symfony/http-client
```

Now you are ready to create a file named `traderspost-test.php` and paste the following code inside of the file.

```php
<?php
// traderspost-test.php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

$webhookUrl = 'https://traderspost.io/trading/webhook/9d9f8620-d60d-416e-827e-0ec01ef93532/9b5b8c4264421f5515fd4fcb6571af50';

$client = HttpClient::create();

$response = $client->request('POST', $webhookUrl, [
    'json' => [
        'ticker' => 'AMD',
        'action' => 'buy',
        'price' => 85.50,
    ]
]);

echo $response->getContent();
```

Now you are ready to send the webhook to TradersPost!

```bash
php traderspost-test.php
{"success":true,"id":"cd481b19-9bb7-4845-8227-523203971d47","payload":{"ticker":"AMD","action":"buy","price":85.50}}
```

This is a simple example, but you can combine this with a service like [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io) to get live real-time market data and build your own completely custom trading strategies and TradersPost can handle the integrations with your broker.
