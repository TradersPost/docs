# Signal Sources

Signal sources refer to platforms or services that provide actionable events related to trading activities, such as buying, selling, or exiting a position. These events can be communicated through various means, most commonly via sending a webhook URL. Webhooks allow these platforms to trigger specific actions automatically when certain conditions are met. Among the most popular signal sources are TradingView and TrendSpider, both of which offer comprehensive tools for charting and strategy alerts, enabling automated trading workflows and timely market actions.
