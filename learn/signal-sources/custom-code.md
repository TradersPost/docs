# Custom Code

In addition to sending webhooks from third parties, you can send webhooks to TradersPost from custom code using programming languages like [PHP](https://php.net) or [Python](https://www.python.org). Here is an example using [PHP](https://php.net) and the [Symfony HTTP Client](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html).

This example uses [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager. First create a new directory to work inside of.

```bash
mkdir traderspost
cd traderspost
```

Now require the `symfony/http-client` package using composer.

```
composer require symfony/http-client
```

Now you are ready to create a file named `traderspost-test.php` and paste the following code inside of the file.

```php
<?php
// traderspost-test.php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

$webhookUrl = 'https://traderspost.io/trading/webhook/9d9f8620-d60d-416e-827e-0ec01ef93532/9b5b8c4264421f5515fd4fcb6571af50';

$client = HttpClient::create();

$response = $client->request('POST', $webhookUrl, [
    'json' => [
        'ticker' => 'AMD',
        'action' => 'buy',
        'price' => 85.50,
    ]
]);

echo $response->getContent();
```

Now you are ready to send the webhook to TradersPost!

```bash
php traderspost-test.php
{"success":true,"id":"cd481b19-9bb7-4845-8227-523203971d47","payload":{"ticker":"AMD","action":"buy","price":85.50}}
```

This is a simple example, but you can combine this with a service like [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io) to get live real-time market data and build your own completely custom trading strategies and TradersPost can handle the integrations with your broker.
