# Prop Firm Trading

TradersPost connects your [TradingView](../learn/signal-sources/tradingview.md) or [TrendSpider](../learn/signal-sources/trend-spider.md) alerts to [Tradovate](../all-supported-connections/tradovate.md) or [ProjectX](../all-supported-connections/projectx.md) prop firm accounts, letting you execute manual or automated futures trades in one, or dozens, of proprietary‑firm evaluation (eval) and funded accounts simultaneously. TradersPost handles the order routing, position sizing, and account‑level risk parameters so you can focus on strategy, not button clicking.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before linking TradersPost to any proprietary trading firm, you must verify that your trading approach complies with that firm’s rules and restrictions. TradersPost does not approve or encourage the use of our platform to circumvent, breach, or otherwise violate a prop firm's terms and conditions. You are solely responsible for understanding, following, and staying up to date with each firm's policies. Failure to do so may result in penalties or account termination imposed by the prop firm and/or suspension of your TradersPost integration. TradersPost accepts no liability for any consequences arising from non‑compliance.

Prop firms differ in what they allow for automation, scaling, and risk. Always confirm that your strategy and order flow comply with each firm's terms. TradersPost offers the tools, but you remain responsible for rule adherence.

## Notes on ProjectX

You must sign up for an account on [ProjectX](https://dashboard.projectx.com/register) to use their API with TradersPost. As of this writing, the subscription is $29/mo. Once this account is set up, you can then link your ProjectX-enabled prop firm to TradersPost.

### How to Connect ProjectX Accounts

### Known Limitations

As of this writing, [ProjectX](../all-supported-connections/projectx.md) prop firm accounts don't support bracket orders which allows TradersPost to automatically attach a specific take profit and stop loss to each entry order. However, it is possible to set risk parameters in your prop firm risk settings with most prop firms that use ProjectX. Please get in touch with your firm's support team for help on setting this up.
