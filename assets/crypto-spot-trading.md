## Crypto Dust

Low quantity crypto holdings (or dust), if above the minimum tradable size with Coinbase, are still considered a position on TradersPost. Usually this is about $1.50 USD worth of crypto or more. As such, if you have a low value for your "[Max strategy positions](../core-concepts/brokers-connections.md#max-strategy-positions)" and you have many dust wallets, you may see rejected orders since those existing wallets count as a position.

If you have any questions about our crypto support, you can email us at [support@traderspost.io](mailto:support@traderspost.io)
