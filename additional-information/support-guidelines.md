# Support Guidelines

## Trade Signal Help

**1 - Find the Trade Signal URL**

If you're having trouble with a trade or signal, please provide as much information about the trade as possible. The best way to get help is to head to your [Strategies](https://app.traderspost.io/app/trading/strategies), find the strategy in question, click "Signals", click the signal where an issue occurred, and share that URL with us. This page is critical because it tells us where the signal came from, what JSON message was in the signal, and what happened to the trade itself.

The URL should look like this:

```
https://app.traderspost.io/app/trading/strategies/<uuid characters/signals/<uuid characters/view
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can then quickly look up your account and the trade issue from this link.

**2 - Provide Context about the Trade**

Next, provide as much detail as possible about the trade, where it came from, how it should have fired and what you expected to happen.

## JSON Guidance

You have a few options when it comes to JSON and what message to use.

1. Ask our AI bot for guidance on the proper message to send. It has been trained to correctly build JSON messages according to [our documentation](https://docs.traderspost.io/docs/core-concepts/webhooks). You can ask it to construct a JSON message for everything from the entry to the bracket take profit and stop loss.
2. Read through the [webhooks](https://docs.traderspost.io/docs/core-concepts/webhooks) section of the documentation for guidance on how to construct a message.
3. If you're still stuck, reach out to an agent and we'll help you.



All other questions and needs can be answered by the team through our support email or through the chat bubble on this page or your [dashboard](https://app.traderspost.io/app/dashboard).
