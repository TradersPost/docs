# Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you support paper trading?

### Can I paper trade with TD Ameritrade?

TD Ameritrade does not support paper trading. Only the ThinkOrSwim platform supports paper trading and ThinkOrSwim does not provide an API for TradersPost to integrate with. If you would like to get started paper trading, you can register a free account with [Alpaca](../paper-trading.md#alpaca) or [TradeStation](../paper-trading.md#tradestation) or use the [TradersPost Paper Trading](../paper-trading.md#traderspost-paper) functionality.

### Do I need TradingView?

No. You can subscribe to existing strategies that have been published on TradersPost. An account on TradingView is only required if you want to connect your own custom strategies to TradersPost.

### What happens to existing positions when I connect my broker?

If you connect an account with existing open positions, TradersPost will not do anything to those positions unless your strategy subscription has those tickers selected. It is up to you to be sure your manual trading does not conflict with the tickers being managed by TradersPost. It is recommended that you use an account dedicated to TradersPost but we do not strictly disallow you from trading manually in the same account.

### How old is TradersPost?

TradersPost was founded by [Jonathan Wage](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwage/) on January 1st 2021.

### Is TradersPost free?

TradersPost is free to get started. You can paper trade for free for 90 days. Once you are ready to trade live with real money, a paid subscription is required.

### I don't have a supported broker, how can I get started?

TradersPost comes with an unlimited amount of free paper accounts that lets you test strategies and get familiar with the platform.

### Does TradersPost support ThinkOrSwim?

Yes, we support TD Ameritrade accounts with ThinkOrSwim advanced features disabled. If you have ThinkOrSwim advanced features enabled, you may experience unexpected behavior and you will not have the ability to use OCO take profit and stop loss orders. It is recommended to use TradersPost with accounts that have ThinkOrSwim advanced features disabled.

### Do you have an API?

No, but it is on our 2022 roadmap. The only way currently to integrate strategies with TradersPost is via [Webhooks](../webhooks.md).

### Are trades executed on my own dedicated server?

No, TradersPost is a software as a service and is hosted in a cloud environment. If you'd like to discuss dedicated automated trading systems, please email [support@traderspost.io](mailto:support@traderspost.io).

### What happens if a signal is received when the market is closed?

The resulting orders will be either queued for the next market open on the TradersPost side or on the broker side. You can read more about [Order Queueing](../order-queueing.md) here.

### Why was my order rejected by my broker?

Unfortunately, TradersPost does not have much visibility in to the backend of the brokers we integrate with and they and the parties that execute orders may choose to reject orders for a variety of different reasons. If you are unsure why something was rejected, please contact your brokers support team. If you are still unsure, email us at [support@traderspost.io](mailto:support@traderspost.io).
