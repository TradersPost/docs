# Prop Firm Trading

TradersPost connects your [TradingView](../learn/tradingview.md) or [TrendSpider](../learn/trend-spider.md) alerts to [NinjaTrader](../core-concepts/brokers/ninjatrader.md)/[Tradovate](../core-concepts/brokers/broker-roadmap/tradovate.md), letting you execute manual or automated futures trades in one, or dozens, of proprietary‑firm evaluation (eval) and funded accounts simultaneously. TradersPost handles the order routing, position sizing, and account‑level risk parameters so you can focus on strategy, not button clicking.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before linking TradersPost to any proprietary trading firm, you must verify that your trading approach complies with that firm’s rules and restrictions. TradersPost does not approve or encourage the use of our platform to circumvent, breach, or otherwise violate a prop firm's terms and conditions. You are solely responsible for understanding, following, and staying up to date with each firm's policies. Failure to do so may result in penalties or account termination imposed by the prop firm and/or suspension of your TradersPost integration. TradersPost accepts no liability for any consequences arising from non‑compliance.

Prop firms differ in what they allow for automation, scaling, and risk. Always confirm that your strategy and order flow comply with each firm's terms. TradersPost offers the tools, but you remain responsible for rule adherence.
