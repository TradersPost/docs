# Glossary

## A

**Account Scaling:** Also known as parallel account execution, copy trading, or multi-account trading, account scaling is a way to trade multiple accounts at the same time. Usually done in [prop firm accounts](../assets/prop-firm-trading.md), you can scale your own accounts by subscribing multiple broker connections to a single strategy.

**Asset Class**: A group of similar financial instruments. TradersPost currently supports trading in stocks, options, futures, and spot crypto. Support for forex is planned.

**Auto submit:** The main TradersPost feature that allows trading signals to be automatically executed on a connected broker account without requiring manual review or approval. When Auto Submit is enabled, incoming signals immediately route orders to the broker based on the strategy's predefined parameters. If disabled, signals are held in a pending state, allowing the user to review and approve each trade before execution.

## E

**Event-driven Execution:** The underlying system design of TradersPost where trading actions are triggered in response to real-time external events, specifically, signals sent from platforms like TradingView, TrendSpider, or others. When an event (signal) occurs, TradersPost immediately processes it, determines the correct strategy, and routes the appropriate order instructions to the connected broker or exchange. This enables highly responsive, automated trading based entirely on external signals, rather than scheduled or continuously polling algorithms.

## J

[**JSON Message**](../core-concepts/json-messages.md)**:** The standardized data format TradersPost uses to receive and process trading signals. A platform like TradingView or TrendSpider sends a JSON message via webhook that includes all the necessary trade instructions, such as the ticker symbol, trade action (buy, sell, exit), quantity, price at signal time, timestamp, and optional extras like custom exit types or risk controls. TradersPost parses this message and translates it into executable orders for your connected broker accounts, enabling fully automated and highly customizable trading.

## L

**Live trading:** Live trading refers to executing trades in a real, funded brokerage or exchange account where actual capital is at risk. When signals are received, orders are submitted to live markets, filled at current prices, and result in real financial gains or losses based on market outcomes.

## P

**Paper trading:** Paper trading allows users to simulate trading without risking real money. Orders are processed and executed in a virtual account that mirrors real market conditions, enabling users to test strategies, refine automation settings, and gain confidence before switching to live trading.

**Prop firm trading:** Prop firm trading refers to trading evaluation and funded accounts provided by proprietary trading firms like Apex Trader Funding or Topstep. These accounts are typically simulated accounts that mirror real market conditions but do not involve live capital, even during the "funded" phase. Traders use their own strategies to meet the firm's profit and risk targets during evaluation, and upon passing, continue trading in a simulated environment with the opportunity to earn payouts based on performance. TradersPost allows users to automate trading across multiple prop firm accounts by connecting these accounts through supported brokers like Tradovate, or platforms like ProjectX, enabling fully automated strategy execution while following the firm's trading rules and risk limits.

## S

[**Signal (Trade Signal)**](../core-concepts/signals.md)**:** A signal, or trade signal, is a real-time instruction generated by a charting platform, indicator, or trading strategy that tells TradersPost when to execute a trade. This signal is delivered through a webhook URL provided by TradersPost, where the external platform sends a structured JSON message containing the details of the trade, such as the ticker, action (buy or sell), quantity, price, and any additional instructions. Once the JSON message is received through the webhook, TradersPost parses it, applies the user's strategy settings, and routes the corresponding order to the connected broker or exchange for execution.

[**Strategy**](../core-concepts/strategies.md)**:** A Strategy in TradersPost is the central place where the webhook URL is provided and all subscriptions (broker connections) are established. Within a strategy, users define the asset class (stocks, options, futures, or crypto), select the trading style (systematic or discretionary), set security controls and allowed tickers, and configure the default settings that apply to all future subscriptions (broker connections) created under that strategy. Each strategy includes a unique webhook URL, which external platforms use to deliver JSON messages containing trade signals. From the Strategy Dashboard, users can monitor and manage all active subscriptions linked to the strategy, ensuring full visibility and control over how signals are routed and executed.

[**Subscription**](../core-concepts/subscriptions.md) **(also called Strategy Subscription):** A Subscription in TradersPost represents the connection between a Strategy and a specific broker or exchange account. Each subscription determines how incoming signals from the strategy's webhook URL are processed for that particular account, including settings like auto submit, position size, account-specific overrides, and risk controls. Subscriptions inherit default settings from the strategy at the time of creation, but can be customized individually to suit the needs of each connected account. Multiple subscriptions can be created under a single strategy, allowing users to execute the same trading signals across multiple accounts simultaneously while maintaining independent controls for each connection.

## T

**Trades:** A Trade in TradersPost represents an individual order that was executed with a broker or exchange through a specific Subscription. Trades are generated after a signal is received and processed according to the subscriptionâ€™s settings, such as position size, risk controls, and any account-specific overrides. Each trade record includes full context, showing the original signal, the strategy it originated from, and the subscription that executed it. The trade also contains detailed broker execution data, including order status, fill prices, and timestamps. If Auto Submit is disabled, trades are initially held in a pending state where users can manually approve or reject each trade before it is submitted to the broker.

## W

[**Webhook**](../core-concepts/webhooks.md)**:** A webhook is an automated method for one web application to communicate with another web application in real-time by sending data or notifications when a specific event occurs. In the context of automating trading, webhooks are used to send a trade signal from one system to another like TradersPost.
