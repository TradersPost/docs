# Maintenance Windows

TradersPost has weekly scheduled maintenance windows on Saturdays from 01:30 AM to 05:30 AM UTC. This corresponds to Friday 9:30 PM to Saturday 1:30 AM Eastern Time.

During these maintenance windows, TradersPost may be temporarily unavailable. However, it is extremely rare for any maintenance to cause prolonged unavailability. We schedule these maintenance windows during times when all markets are closed (except for Crypto) and traffic is at its lowest to minimize the impact on our customers.

If maintenance is required outside of these windows, it will be scheduled and announced via email and Discord. In the event of unplanned maintenance due to unforeseen issues, we will make every effort to communicate this via email and Discord.
